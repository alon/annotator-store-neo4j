The first time	you use annotator you will have the popup blocked, you have to enable popups for localhost (i.e. greasemonkey) via the obvious dialog.

4. Usage: go to any page, make sure greasemonkey is enabled (the monkey icon on the toolbar is not greyed out) and select some text, click the popup icon, enter a description, click save. after 2 seconds the rhizi window opens.
