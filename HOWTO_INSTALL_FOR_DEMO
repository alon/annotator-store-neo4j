0. Launch a local rhizi on port 3000 (important! hardcoded in the greasemonkey script)

1. Install greasemonkey 1.15:
 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/?src=ss

2. Click https://github.com/alon/annotator-store-neo4j/raw/development/static/greasemonkey/annotator-everywhere.user.js

Click through the wizard

3. Enable popups:

This is the annoying bit - every site you annotate will try to popup rhizi, so you need to let it - would be nice to enable popups globaly

4. Usage: go to any page, make sure greasemonkey is enabled (the monkey icon on the toolbar is not greyed out) and select some text, click the popup icon, enter a description, click save. after 2 seconds the rhizi window opens.
